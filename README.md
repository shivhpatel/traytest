# Project Title

You will write a program that navigates a imaginary robotic hoover (much like a Roomba) through an equally imaginary room based on (x, y) coordinates. The goal of the program is to take the room dimensions, the locations of the dirt patches, the hoover location and the driving instructions as input and to then output the following:
(1) The final hoover position (X, Y)
(2) The number of patches of dirt the robot cleaned up

## Getting Started

Download repository traytest

### Prerequisites

an IDE, like Visual Studio Code

### Installing

1. Download traytest reposiory
2. Run index.js file

If ran, for given input.txt, the result should be:
(1) The final hoover position (X, Y) = (1, 3)
(2) The number of patches of dirt the robot cleaned up - (1)

## Running the tests

Change input.txt file and hoover, dirtLocation, hooverDirections constants in index.js
